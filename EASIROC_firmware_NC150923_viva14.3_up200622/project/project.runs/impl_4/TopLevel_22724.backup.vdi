Phase 4.7 Clock Restriction Legalization for Non-Clock Pins
WARNING: [Constraints 18-647] Placement may not be routable. The following cell(s) are grouped together and are placed in one single tile. The total number of clocks on non-clock pins of these cells is greater than 2, therefore, placer is not able to legalize the design to satisfy the suggested number of clocks that can drive non-clock pins in a single tile. Please modify the design such that each cell has at most 2 clocks driving its non-clock pins. Also, if one or more cells should be grouped together and placed in one tile, make sure the total number of such clocks does not exceed the maximum suggested.
ClockManager_0/MMCM_0/OUT_FPGA_OBUF[3]_inst_i_5

WARNING: [Constraints 18-643] Placement may not be routable as design contains luts and/or flops whose data pins are driven by global clock signals and final placement is such that the number of such signals exceed the suggested number of such clocks in a single tile, which is 2. The following clock nets need to be routed to non-clock pins in tile CLBLM_R_X3Y80:
