the first version by Naruhiro Chikuma  

----- Modified

injection pattern of test charge is added   

        when "001" =>  1   
           CAL1 <= 'Z'; -- High Impedance    
           CAL2 <= test_palse;   
        when "010" =>  2   
           CAL1 <= test_palse;   
           CAL2 <= test_palse;  
        when others => 0   
           CAL1 <= test_palse;   
           CAL2 <= 'Z'; -- High Impedance

      # Explanation of parameters below   
      # 1: The default operation:   
      #     By adjusting Trig, one needs to put HOLD, STOP, & ACCEPT individually.  
      # 2: Semi-internal trigger:  
      #     By adjusting Trig, one needs to input HOLD. STOP & ACCEPT are internally generated.   
      # 3: All-internal trigger:  
      #     Based on logic Trig, all three pulses: HOLD, STOP, & ACCEPT are internally generated.   
      Mode: 3  
      DelayTrigger: 10 # Adjustable delay with the internal 250 MHz CLOCK ( reso. 4nsec ):   
                       #   15 is close to peak: KEK-No.15  
      DelayHold:    -1 # 25MHz : internally fixed since its not useful @ 20/03/01  
      DelayL1Trig:  -1 # 6MHz  : internally fixed since its not useful @ 20/03/01

important commands  

   - statusInputDAC : <ch(0..63) / all(64)> put a status file under status/ 
   - checkHVstability : check HV stability for ~ 30 min using above command  
   - setThresholdDAC   

   - setSelectbaleLogic :  <0..63> only is activated = OneCh_XX  
   - activateIndividual64 : loop using above to see trigger bevaviour on an oscilloscope        

  HV Controlles    
   - setHV       <bias voltage (00.00~90.00)> @ don't use! this increases at once @  
   - stepSetHV   <bias voltage> : step by step  
   - convergeHV  <bias voltage> : step by step and coverge it by looking HV monitor  
   - statusHV  
   - checkHV     <voltage_limit=80> <current_limit=20> <repeat_count=3>  
   - turnOffHV   : step by step to 0   
 
  Internal Trigger Ptn and Delay: see yaml/RegisterValue.yml   
   - setTriggerMode   : <0: ,>  
   - setTriggerDelay  : <0: ,>  

  Pulse Calibration:  
   - setTestPulsePtn  : <0,1,2>   
   - setTestPulseTo   : <0..63> each chip and ch by ch (recommended)   
   - calibrateIndividual64 : input test pulse to each chip and ch by ch (recommended) 
   - calibrateTrigDelayTime : scan trigger delay
